##  Building an Inclusive Organizing Committee

The organizing committee itself should reflect the diversity you want to create in your conference! 
Prioritizing diversity starts with you.

‚úÖ Conference chairs and lead organizers should take special care to recruit an organizing committee that reflects the diversity of the event you aspire to create.

- Look for balance along many dimensions: seniority, topical expertise, geography, academia/industry, gender/racial/ethnic balance, disability status, academic lineage and many more.
- Ensure a good mix of long-term expertise and institutional memory with a flow of new people.
- Avoid cronyism: Use algorithmic and term-limited approaches to constitute the steering committee.

Offer in-person or online ‚Äúunconscious bias‚Äù, harassment, and ethics training materials for steering committee members and major conference organizers.
- Either before the conference or during the conference
- Prioritize candidates for the steering/program committee and organizing positions who have availed themselves of such training (track who has completed training)
- Document conference and steering committee policies on a public webpage

When creating the organizing committee, be aware of the specific roles assigned to individuals. Avoid a situation in which the ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù roles are all assigned to women or other individuals from underrepresented groups. The goal is to achieve diversity across many roles, including those of high technical prestige.
- Consider having a member of the organizing committee specifically responsible for mitigating/preventing bias and weaving inclusivity throughout the conference (e.g. "diversity chair" or co-chairs).
- ‚ÄúWe tried, but they turned us down.‚Äù For both the organizing committee and also the program committee be ready with ‚Äúspare‚Äù names. Since there are relatively fewer women and underrepresented minorities in the community, they are often asked to do disproportionate amounts of service, and thus are frequently forced to say no at a higher rate.

## Inclusive practices during check-in

### üçé Photography Permissions 

 - Managing photography opt-outs: 
    - Badge lanyard at registration should be made available to indicate photo preferences (green = photos fine; yellow = ask first; red = no photos) 

### üçé Pronoun Pins, Buttons, or Ribbons

  - Indicating pronouns:
    - Select a pin/button/ribbon for your lanyard to communicate your pronouns. Using a pin even if you don't feel like you need one helps create a welcoming space for attendees who do.
    - Color-coordinate the pins by pronoun for quicker recognition and processing by those who see the pins. This lowers the barrier to checking (look at the color). 
      - Be sure to choose colors that works for folks with color-blindness. With color-coded pins, needing to actually read them is a stress case rather than the norm. Because people are used to the ease of the normal case, they're more willing to take a little extra effort to read for the stress cases. (purple: he, yellow: she, green: they, blue: ask)
      - To be aware of: Make pins large enough to be easily seen. Made the pronoun itself the largest text, rather than the word &quot;Pronouns&quot;.
    - Another option for pronoun indication is ribbons.
      - Have custom ones printed for Zi/Zir and a "Fill in your own" ribbon. For fill in your own, make sure you provide fabric markers. (h/t @oxinabox)

- [AdaCamp Toolkit on Photography/video/audio recording](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/policies/#photo)

### Welcoming New Attendees

- Ribbons for badges can be useful, e.g. &quot;First-Time Attendee.&quot; 
  - Consider what visual cues would encourage people to engage with one another and go out of their way to be friendly to someone.
- Consider running a mentoring program that matches experienced attendees with first-timers for networking and to provide a friendly resource to get to know the conference.

### Social Events

- &quot;First-Time Attendee&quot; lunch/dinner/coffee-break as a welcome and safe place for attendees to ask questions.
- Consider diversifying the time of day that social events happen.
  - Not everyone is available (physically or mentally) in the evenings, when social events are typically concentrated.
- Alcohol Considerations
  - We recommend the [AdaCamp Toolkit&#39;s summary approach to alcohol at events](https://adacamp.org/adacamp-toolkit/serving-alcohol-at-social-events/)

## Website & Registration

What to ask on your registration form (and what not to ask)

### Preparing to meet accessibility needs

- Outline any accessibility services you plan to provide on the registration form. Then:
- üçé Ask registrants if they have any additional accessibility needs, and if so, provide instructions on how to make the request.
  - &quot;Do you need any special accommodations to help make your time at the conference comfortable and productive? (e.g. accessibility considerations). Please email [contact@myconference.com](mailto:contact@myconference.com) and include the details of your request.&quot;
- Provide any deadlines for requests (it can be difficult to arrange sign-language translation at the last minute, for example).

### Supporting Attendance through Grants

- Ask about any grant or scholarship opportunities, e.g. for childcare, scholarships for underrepresented folks
  - &quot;Would you be interested in a grant to cover childcare or on-site childcare services? (yes/no) Which option would be most beneficial for you?&quot;

### Dietary Restrictions

- üçé Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect their ability to attend the conference.
- Use an open text box to ask about dietary restrictions. (Forcing registrants to choose from a pre-defined list might miss important allergies or restrictions.)
  - &quot;Do you have any dietary restrictions we should be aware of? (e.g. allergies)&quot;

### Photo Policy

- üçé If you will have a photographer at your event, include information for attendees explaining that they may be photographed and how to opt out.
  - (see lanyard/photography explanation under [Inclusive Practices](11_inclusive_practices_during_checkin.md))

### Code of Conduct

- üçé Show the text of the Code of Conduct and a required check-box that the registrant has read it and agrees to abide by it.

### T-Shirts

If you plan to offer t-shirts, consider offering more than one cut/fit of shirt.
- Provide shirt sizing information with the registration form where you ask for shirt size. (Provide a wide range of sizes, including plus-size.)
- Describe the cut in gender-neutral terms (e.g. &quot;fitted&quot; vs. &quot;straight-cut&quot;) with photo examples, rather than using gender-loaded terms (&quot;men&#39;s,&quot; &quot;women&#39;s,&quot; &quot;unisex&quot;).

### Demographic Info

- **Why do you need it?**
  - We recommend you do not ask for information just &quot;out of curiosity&quot; but rather that there are **planned actions you will take depending on the results** of your demographic question(s).
  - If you are asking just for the purpose of &quot;counting&quot; or ascertaining the diversity of your conference, we suggest doing this in the form of an anonymous post-survey instead, to protect participant privacy.
- If you absolutely must include demographic info in your registration form, **make it optional, not required**. Forcing people to identify themselves by demographic category is not an inclusive practice and may prompt [stereotype threat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat).
- ‚úÖ If you do collect demographic info, be thoughtful about the structure of the questions so that they are inclusive and don&#39;t contribute to alienating or &quot;othering&quot; marginalized people.
  - Not having an answer choice that matches your identity can be a very alienating experience.
- ‚úÖ Take anonymity and data security seriously. Have a plan for limiting access to this information and keeping it secure.
- Suggested format for demographic question:
  - &quot;Do you self-identify as an underrepresented minority in either the [conference] community or in your professional field?&quot;
    - &quot;Along which dimension(s) you self-identify as underrepresented? Check all that apply:&quot;
         - Gender identity
         - Ethnicity, nationality, skin color, race
         - Sexual orientation
         - Socioeconomic status
         - Religion
         - Age
         - Ability
         - Do not wish to provide
         - Other (please specify)

(pacman_rule)=
## Pacman Rule

- Encourage participants to ask questions in multiple formats, including verbal, written, or through digital platforms (e.g., a dedicated website or social media hashtag). This inclusivity allows for diverse participation and ensures that everyone has a chance to contribute.

- Offer a platform for written questions, such as a website or a Twitter hashtag, to allow participants to submit their inquiries anonymously or at their own pace. This can help quieter individuals or those with communication challenges to engage more comfortably.

- Foster a safe and respectful environment for questions, where all inquiries are welcomed and valued. This encourages participation from individuals who may otherwise hesitate to speak up.

- Consider having a moderator to facilitate the Q&A session, ensuring that questions are addressed in a balanced manner and that all participants have an opportunity to contribute.

- Implement a feedback mechanism to gather insights on the Q&A process, allowing for continuous improvement in how questions are managed and ensuring that all voices are heard in future events.


(asking_questions_during_talks)=
## Asking Questions During Talks

Encouraging questions during and after talks is essential for fostering engagement and ensuring that all participants feel included. Here are some best practices to enhance the Q&A experience for everyone:

1. **Provide Multiple Formats for Questions**:
   - Allow participants to ask questions verbally, in writing, or through digital platforms. This flexibility accommodates different communication preferences and needs.

2. **Written Question Opportunities**:
   - Offer a platform for participants to submit questions in writing, such as a dedicated website or a Twitter hashtag. This approach is particularly beneficial for individuals who are hearing or speech impaired, as well as for those who may feel shy or less confident in speaking up.

3. **Create a Safe Environment**:
   - Foster a welcoming atmosphere where all questions are valued and respected. Encourage participants to share their inquiries without fear of judgment, which can help create a more inclusive environment.

4. **Utilize Moderation**:
   - Consider having a moderator to facilitate the Q&A session. The moderator can help manage the flow of questions, ensuring that everyone has an opportunity to contribute and that questions are addressed fairly.

5. **Encourage Anonymity**:
   - Allow participants to submit questions anonymously if they prefer. This can help those who may feel uncomfortable asking questions in front of a large audience to engage more freely.

6. **Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Implement a feedback mechanism to gather insights on the Q&A process. This can help organizers understand what worked well and what could be improved for future events, ensuring that all voices are heard.

7. **Follow-Up Opportunities**:
   - Provide opportunities for follow-up questions or discussions after the talk. This can be done through informal gatherings or online forums, allowing participants to continue the conversation in a more comfortable setting.

By implementing these practices, organizers can create a more inclusive and engaging environment for asking questions during talks, ensuring that all participants feel empowered to contribute.

### Accessible Conference Website

Creating an accessible conference website is essential for ensuring that all participants, including those with disabilities, can access information and engage fully with the event. Here are key considerations and best practices for developing an accessible conference website:

1. **Adhere to Accessibility Standards**:
   - Ensure that your website complies with the **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0**. This includes making sure that the site is navigable and usable for individuals with various disabilities.

2. **Screen Reader Compatibility**:
   - Test the website with popular screen readers (e.g., JAWS, NVDA) to ensure that all content is accessible. Use semantic HTML to help screen readers interpret the content correctly.

3. **Clear Navigation**:
   - Design the website with clear and consistent navigation. Use headings, lists, and links that are easy to understand and follow. This helps users with cognitive disabilities navigate the site more effectively.

4. **Text Alternatives for Non-Text Content**:
   - Provide alternative text (alt text) for images, charts, and other non-text content. This allows screen reader users to understand the context and purpose of visual elements.

5. **Accessible Forms**:
   - Ensure that all forms on the website are accessible. This includes labeling form fields clearly and providing instructions for completion. Use error messages that are descriptive and helpful.

6. **Color Contrast and Text Size**:
   - Use high-contrast color combinations to ensure readability for users with visual impairments. Additionally, allow users to adjust text size without losing functionality.

7. **Mobile Accessibility**:
   - Ensure that the website is responsive and accessible on mobile devices. Many users may access the site from smartphones or tablets, so it‚Äôs important that the experience is seamless across all devices.

8. **Accessibility Information**:
   - Include a dedicated section on the website that outlines the accessibility features available at the conference. This should include:
     - Information on how to request accommodations.
     - Details about the accessibility of the venue(s).
     - Transportation options for attendees with mobility challenges.
     - Contact information for local accessibility services.

9. **Feedback Mechanism**:
   - Implement a feedback mechanism on the website to gather insights from attendees regarding accessibility. This can help improve future events and address any concerns.

10. **Further Reading**:
    - For more detailed guidance on creating an accessible conference website, refer to the **[SIGACCESS Accessible Conference Guide](http://www.sigaccess.org/welcome-to-sigaccess/resources/accessible-conference-guide/#website)**. This resource offers comprehensive information for organizers looking to enhance accessibility at their events.

By following these guidelines, you can create a more inclusive and accessible conference experience for all participants, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to engage fully with the event.
